## My github repositories about MRI

* [dMRI data](https://github.com/yhao-z/dMRI-Data). (dMRI means Dynamic Magnetic Resonance Imaging, which is inherent a 3 or high dimensional images. )
* [sampling mask for dMRI](https://github.com/yhao-z/Sampling-Mask-MRI) : the under-sampling mask for dMRI, just 3 dimensional, contains variable/uniform density random sampling, variable/uniform density y-line sampling by randomly and variably/uniformly selecting k-space rows, and radio sampling
* [dMRI utilities](https://github.com/yhao-z/dMRI-utils) : Hermite symmetric FFT and IFFT, calculating SNR and PSNR codes.
* [TMNN](https://github.com/yhao-z/TMNN) : The code of the conference paper "Dynamic Cardiac MRI Reconstruction Using Combined Tensor Nuclear Norm and Casorati Matrix Nuclear Norm Regularizations."

## Useful repositories about Harbin Institute of Technology

* [HIT thesis word template](https://github.com/yhao-z/HIT-thesis-template-word) is a word template for Harbin Institute of Technology thesis, just for undergraduate.
