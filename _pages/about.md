My name is Sheng Mai (麦晟), I just finished my Msc Cognitive Neuroscience at University College London and supervised by Prof [Sarah Garfinkel](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/icn/sarah-garfinkel) and studied about Heart Rate Variability. I am looking for A Phd position in Neuroscience at UK or USA.

I’m broadly interested in the intersection of deep learning and neuroscience. I am working on   and likely push it into market (funded). I have a good background in statistics and math in research anaylysis (includes Bayesian and functional analysis). I have research experience on theory of achievement emotion, interpersonal relationship theories， "action conception" framework,  neurodegenerative disorders and EEG.
